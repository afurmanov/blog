This is source code for my blog which is a Single Page App (SPA) and
Node.js based server.

I wrote it to get an sense what is:

- Build a complete SPA not based on any framework (_Ember.js_,
_Backbone_, _Angular_, etc.). It still uses _MVC_ pattern to organize
client side logic.

- Build a Node.js application where dataflow built around Promises
